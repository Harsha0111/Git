Fetch vs Pull:
*************
 Git fetch is a safer alternative because it pulls in all the commits,
  from your remote to local repository, but doesn't make any changes to your working directory files.
  and if you give below command the latest code by git pull will reflect in your working dir.
 $ git merge 

In git pull it's single command:
  On the other hand, Git pull is directly downloading the latest code to working directory.

*******************************
  git pull = directly apply latest code changes to working directory
  git fetch = git fetch + git checkout(optional if need to specify branch to apply the changes)
            + git merge
