git merge- is used to merge the branches from one branch to another

*****
****************************************************
 Types of merge branch:
        1.fast forward
        2.not fast-forward

********************************
scenario:
**********
From master node having a feature branch in that feature branch made some additional features named:f1 branch, then we need to merge this f1 branch to master branch, how do we do it?
***********
 solution:
 ********
 switch to destination branch(master) first:
 note: after creating feature branch there is no new branch in master, so it's known as 
 "Fast Forward merge" (hint:like linear/straight manner)

 $ git checkout master

 then, enter the below command:
 $ git merge <branch_name>

 here, the branch name is f1
 $ git merge f1
